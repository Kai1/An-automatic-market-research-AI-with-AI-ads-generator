## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You Need to Know First

Before we start, here are some basic concepts:

- **Analysis**: The system looks at your content and understands what makes it good
- **Video Generation**: The system creates a new video based on what it learned
- **AI Prompt**: A detailed instruction that tells the AI exactly what to create

Think of it like having a smart assistant that:
1. Studies your content
2. Understands what works well
3. Creates a new video using those best practices

## 💻 Installation

### Step 1: Check Your Computer

First, make sure you have:
- **Windows 10 or 11** (or Mac/Linux)
- **Python 3.8 or newer** (we'll help you check this)
- **At least 4GB of free space** on your computer

### Step 2: Download and Setup

1. **Download the project** (you've already done this!)
2. **Open Command Prompt** (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
3. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\path\to\your\Ventamin AI folder"
   ```

### Step 3: Install Python (if needed)

**Check if Python is installed:**
```bash
python --version
```

**If you see an error, download Python:**
